# Project No2: Portfolio Website

Î™n this project, we built a portfolio website. 
It was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and we had to replicate that design in HTML and CSS.
We developed a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects that we are going to complete through the course of your Nanodegree program.

### Future improvements
